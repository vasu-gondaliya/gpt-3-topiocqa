The winds are further twisted due to Coriolis effect.\nQuestion: could i know more about the effect mentioned above?\nAnswer: This is an apparent, but fictitious, force that arises when an observer is in a rotating reference frame, due to the conservation of angular momentum of the air as it moves towards or away from the Earth's axis of rotation.\nQuestion: how is it related to the wind conditions?\nAnswer: They are associated with light winds at the surface and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere.\nQuestion: what is the last term used above?\nAnswer: It is the lowest layer of earth's atmosphere.\nQuestion: what does it consist of?\nAnswer: Nitrogrn, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and small amounts of other gases.\nQuestion: who discovered the former from the list above?\nAnswer: Daniel Rutherford.\nQuestion: what are its properties?\nAnswer: It has seven electrons and one of the highest electronegativities among the elements.\nQuestion: what are its uses?\nAnswer: Synthetically produced nitrogenous compounds like ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.\nQuestion: regarding, the water systems process mentioned by you, is it a natural process?\nAnswer: It is mostly caused by phosphate and nitrogen from various human sources.\nQuestion: where is the scientist mentioned above from?\nAnswer:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Scotland.
